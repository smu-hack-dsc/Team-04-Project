### Image Search

Enhance your shopping experience with our advanced image search feature:

- **User Image Upload**: Users can upload images of clothing items they're interested in.
- **Image to Vector Embeddings**: Uploaded images are processed using TensorFlow to generate vector embeddings, compact mathematical representations.
- **Pinecone Vector Database**: Vector embeddings are stored in the Pinecone database, optimized for efficient similarity searches.
- **Precise Recommendations**: Based on similarity scores, the system retrieves clothing items with the most similar vector embeddings. This process ensures accurate and tailored recommendations for visually similar clothing items.

### Text Search

Effortlessly find the perfect attire using our AI-powered text search feature:

- **User Input Search**: Users can search for clothing items using natural language queries, such as descriptions or keywords.
- **OpenAI Chat API**: User inputs, along with meticulously designed prompts, are sent to the OpenAI Chat API. The user inputs are processed to extract keywords that align with our categories. OpenAI sends back a JSON response which adheres to a format specified in the prompt.
- **Filter Function**: The generated JSON responses are processed by a filter function. This function refines and organizes the results to provide users with a tailored list of related products.

### Size Recommender

Make informed clothing sizing decisions using our size recommender feature:

- **Personalized Fit**: Users' measurements and clothing fit preferences (e.g., tight, normal, loose) are retrieved upon user registration.
